FaceGuard-Attendance: A Secure & Anti-Spoofing Facial Recognition Attendance System

This project is an advanced facial recognition-based attendance system with liveness detection to prevent spoofing attacks. It uses:
✔ Face Recognition (via face_recognition library)
✔ Liveness Verification (eye blink, mouth movement, head pose)
✔ Anti-Spoofing (screen detection, facial landmark analysis)
✔ SQLite Database for attendance logs & performance metrics
✔ Flask Web Interface for admin & user interaction

Key Features:
✅ Real-time face detection & recognition
✅ Prevents photo/video replay attacks
✅ Tracks recognition accuracy & spoofing attempts
✅ Daily attendance logs with timestamp
✅ Admin dashboard for analytics

Built with Python, OpenCV, dlib, and Flask, this system ensures secure and automated attendance marking while maintaining resistance against common facial spoofing techniques.
